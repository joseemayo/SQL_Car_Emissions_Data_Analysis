In this SQL project, using the CO2 emissions by vehicle dataset containing data from the Canadian's Government website, I've done an exploratary analysis using basic to advanced SQL queries.

The raw dataset was downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/debajyotipodder/co2-emission-by-vehicles?resource=download

I used SQLite on a local server imported the CSV files to a local SQL Database local machine to carry forward with the analysis.
